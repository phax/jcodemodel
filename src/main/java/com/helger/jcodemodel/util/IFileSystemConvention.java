/**
 * <p>
 * JCodeModel is used to create a model of the code. This model is then exported
 * from the java representation into files with
 * {@link JCMWriter#build(com.helger.jcodemodel.writer.AbstractCodeWriter, com.helger.jcodemodel.writer.AbstractCodeWriter)}.
 * In order to export the model as files (both .java class definitions, and
 * resources), it needs to be sure the targeted environment can accept the files
 * names. It therefore needs to enforce constraints, to warn the user when it
 * tries to create a file whose name is invalid for the targeted platform.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The target file system is set at the creation of the JCM, with by default the
 * local platform specs: If I am coding on windows, by default I need to respect
 * windows' naming specs, and if on linux, linux' naming specs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It's important that I can change the target platform because, the files may
 * be written into a jar file, or on a FTP server, instead of local platform
 * files, or in memory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It's unlikely to need to change the target after the creation of the first
 * class, and can lead to errors - hence throw an unsupportedoperationException
 * when changing the target of theJCM after class/directory is already created.
