/**
 * <h1>Library for generating Java source code</h1>.
 * <p>
 * CodeModel is a library that allows you to generate Java source code in a
 * type-safe fashion.
 * <p>
 * With CodeModel, you build the java source code by first building AST, then
 * writing it out as text files that is Java source files. The AST looks like
 * this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>@DotDiagram
 digraph G {
 cls1 [label="JDefinedClass"];
 cls2 [label="JDefinedClass"];
 JCodeModel -&gt; cls1 [label="generated class"];
 JCodeModel -&gt; cls2 [label="generated class"];

 m1 [label="JMethod"];
 m2 [label="JMethod"];

 cls1 -&gt; m1;
 cls1 -&gt; m2;
 cls1 -&gt; JField;

 m1 -&gt; JVar [label="method parameter"];
 m1 -&gt; JBlock [label="code"];
 }
 * }</code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You bulid this tree mostly from top-down. So, you first create a new
 * {@link com.helger.jcodemodel.JDefinedClass} from
 * {@link com.helger.jcodemodel.JCodeModel}, then you create a
 * {@link com.helger.jcodemodel.JMethod} from
 * {@link com.helger.jcodemodel.JDefinedClass}, and so on.
 * <p>
 * This design brings the following beneefits:
 * <ul>
 * <li>source code can be written in random order
 * <li>generated source code nicely imports other classes
 * <li>generated source code is lexically always correct (no unbalanced
 * parenthesis, etc.)
 * <li>code generation becomes relatively type-safe
 * </ul>
 * The price you pay for that is increased memory footprint and the generation
 * speed. See <a href="#performance">performance section</a> for more
 * discussions about the performance and possible improvements.
 * <h2>Using CodeModel</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link com.helger.jcodemodel.JCodeModel} is the entry point to the library.
 * See its javadoc for more details about how to use CodeModel.
 * <h2>Performance</h2>
 * <p>
 * Generally speaking, CodeModel is expected to be used in an environment where
 * the resource constraint is not severe. Therefore, we haven't spent much
 * effort in trying to make this library lean and mean.
 * <p>
 * That said, we did some benchmark and performance analysis. In case anyone is
 * interested in making this library better performance wise, here's the
 * findings.
 * <p>
 * {@link java.util.List}s {@link java.util.Map}s, and other collections take up
 * a lot of space. Allocating those things lazily is generally a good idea.
 * <p>
 * Compared to template-based code generator, the writing operation is slow, as
 * it needs to traverse each AST node. Consider pre-encoding tokens (like
 * 'public') to the target encoding, and consider exploting the subtree
 * equivalence. [at]ArchitectureDocument
